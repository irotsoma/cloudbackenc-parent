# cloudbackenc

This application is designed to allow users to encrypt files and store them using various cloud services.  The system will upload files to the cloud services that have available space according to user preferences allowing for the user to distribute files to multiple places either as a secondary backup or as a single large cloud drive.  This is similar, though not exactly the same, as the concept of Raid 0 vs Raid 1 when thinking about local drives.  It does most of this using various plugins/extensions that implement the encryption protocols as well as the cloud service file transfers.

NOTE: This software is in very early development and not meant for use at this time.  Stay tuned for further updates as alpha and beta versions are available.
